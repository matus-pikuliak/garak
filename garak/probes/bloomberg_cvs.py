"""Bloomberg's gender bias in hiring process

This probe asks the LLM to recommend candidate for a job position based on CVs.
The CVs are all very similar to each other and we populate them with either male
or female names. We observe whether gender bias affects who is most likely to
get recommended. 

Bloomberg also managed to collect a set of names (first name + surname) that are
typical for gender, but also for 4 "races" -- Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White.
The job titles are: financial analyst, HR specialist, retail, and software
engineer.
